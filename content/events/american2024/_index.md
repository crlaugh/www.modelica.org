The **American Modelica Conference 2022** will be a hybrid conference event, the first opportunity since the 2019 conference to meet your Modelica colleagues in person, and can also be attended remotely via streaming. The conference will take place at the University of Texas in Dallas at the [Davidson-Gundy Alumni Center](https://davidson-gundy.utdallas.edu/davidson-gundy/spaces/) **October 26–28, 2022**. It is organized by [NAMUG](https://namug.org/), the North American Modelica Users Group in cooperation with the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association). Join us in person in Dallas or from the comfort of your own home. The ability to watch streamed talks from the conference virtually will be provided for a reduced virtual conference admission fee.

## About the Conference

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to [Modelica](https://modelica.org/), [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org/), [SSP](https://ssp-standard.org/), [eFMI](http://efmi-standard.org/) and [DCP](https://dcp-standard.org/).
The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications.

In addition to paper presentations, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as industrial user presentations, vendor sessions, and an exhibition.
The previous American Modelica conference in 2020 was fully online, saw a record number of registrations compared to in-person events, so this time we want to combine the ease of attendance by remote participants from other continents with the fun of a real, in person event with lively discussions in the breaks and an in-person conference dinner! Note that full paper presentations have to be in person, but industrial user presentations can be given remotely.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Dallas. As a first for a Modelica conference, we are planning to organize a **Modelica-oriented job fair** at the in-person event in Dallas that gives a unique opportunity for employers, students about to graduate, and Modelica practitioners to get to know each other. More details will be forthcoming at this site as the conference date comes closer.  

## Our Sponsors

The **American Modelica Conference 2022** relies heavily on sponsors to keep the ticket prices affordable. Please visit our [Sponsor page](https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/Sponsors.html), and also take the time to check out the sponsor exhibition at the conference.


## Scope of the Conference

[Modelica](https://modelica.org/) is a freely available, equation-based, object-oriented language for convenient and efficient modeling of complex, multi-domain cyber-physical systems described by ordinary differential, difference and algebraic equations. The Modelica language and the companion Modelica Standard Library have been utilized in demanding industrial applications, including full vehicle dynamics, power systems, robotics, buildings and district energy systems, hardware-in-the-loop simulations and embedded control systems. The [Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)](https://www.fmi-standard.org/) is an open standard for the tool-independent exchange of models and for co-simulation. It is supported by many [Modelica and non-Modelica tools](https://modelica.org/tools) and is the key to utilizing Modelica models in non-Modelica environments.

Development in the Modelica Association is organized in [Modelica Association Projects](https://modelica.org/projects):

- LANG - Modelica Language
- LIB - Modelica Libraries
- FMI - Functional Mock-up Interface
- eFMI - Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems
- SSP - System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design
- DCP - Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol

The projects collaborate to design and maintain a set of coordinated standards for modeling and simulation of complex physical systems.

The Modelica conference will bring together people using Modelica and/or other Modelica Association standards modeling, simulation, and control applications, Modelica language designers, tool vendors and library developers. The Modelica Conference provides Modelica users the opportunity to stay informed about the latest language, library, and tool developments, and to get in touch with people working on similar modeling problems. The conference will cover topics such as the following:
- Multi-engineering modeling and simulation with free and commercial Modelica libraries (mechanics, electrical, hydraulics, thermal, fluid, media, chemical, building, automotive, aircraft, ...)
- Automotive applications
- Thermodynamic and energy systems applications
- Mechatronics and robotics applications
- Medicine and biology applications
- Other industrial applications, such as electric drives, power systems, aerospace, etc.
- Large-scale system modeling
- Real-time and hardware-in-the-loop simulation
- Simulation and code generation for embedded control systems
- Simulation acceleration by use of many CPU cores or GPU cores
- Applications of Modelica for optimization and optimal control
- Modelica modeling, simulation and design tools
- Symbolic algorithms and numerical methods for model transformation and simulation
- Discrete modeling techniques − FEM, CFD, DEM (Discrete Element Method), ...
- New features of the Modelica language and of FMI
- Experimental language designs and implementations related to Modelica
- Modelica in other application areas (mathematical programming, databases etc.)
- Modelica for teaching and education
- FMI in Modelica and non-Modelica applications and tools
